# Small talk starters

A list of small talk conversation starters is used on the Meetter app to help distributed teams connect on a personal level. Read more about Meetterâ€™s small talks here (link to the announcement in our blog).

Any small talk conversation starters are very welcome!

This is an open repository under a permissive MIT license. Feel free to re-use them in your own meeting or project.
